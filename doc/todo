To-Do
=====

Use a free monad to get IO out of both the Vorple core and the request handler
* Allow for a custom user action data type and interpreter
* Don't expose our internal action data type
* Getting and setting cookies, getting parameters, and sending the response are
  currently IO actions, but this actually quite silly. Maybe things look more sensible
  with plain-old WAI. (They do.)
* It could almost turn out that the internal core doesn't need IO at all, except that
  we probably still want it for logging. So, that'll be quite the simple instruction
  set.

Add support for non-JSON input and output
* Provide both the JSON and Initialization handler creators
