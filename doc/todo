To-Do
=====

Use Web.Cookie in tests
* Instead of using Network.Wai.Test.Session as the session monad, use StateT Session,
  with Web.Cookies.Cookies as the state
* When a request is run, automatically send and receive cookies
  * Read the standards to determine when one cookie overwrites another
* Provide a function that looks in the state for a cookie with a certain name and
  produces an assertion failure if it doesn't exist
