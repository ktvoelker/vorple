Figure out why the response is getting JSON-encoded twice

Clean up the way we move text around
* Try to generate cookies as directly into a strict ByteString as possible
* Use Aeson to get a Builder for the response value
* See if Aeson can directly accept the request source conduit
* We should probably use Data.Conduit.Attoparsec

Use a free monad to get IO out of both the Vorple core and the request handler
* Allow for a custom user action data type and interpreter
* Don't expose our internal action data type
* Getting and setting cookies, getting parameters, and sending the response are
  currently IO actions, but this actually quite silly. Maybe things look more sensible
  with plain-old WAI. (They do.)
* It could almost turn out that the internal core doesn't need IO at all, except that
  we probably still want it for logging. So, that'll be quite the simple instruction
  set.

Write Haddock documentation

Write tests

Add a DB module that ensures transactionality of requests
