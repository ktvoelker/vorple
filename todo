To-Do
=====

Separate Vorple into two monad transformers
  The outer transformer doesn't require anything app-specific but the options,
  so most of the request handling can happen inside this monad.

  The inner transformer is brought in once the session is available.
    So it actually is just adding StateT

  Don't expose this separation
    Have two different newtype wrappers with a function that can lift
    This will require some duplication of instances, but that's boring code anyway

  Move the types in Web.Vorple.Types and the instances into Web.Vorple.Class

Parse cookies properly
  URL encoding and decoding
  Support for multiple key-value pairs in the cookie string
  Does Scotty or WAI already do this?

Make a Cabal file for Vorple

Write tests

Get rid of Scotty?
