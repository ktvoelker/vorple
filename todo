To-Do
=====

Standardize the types of noAuth, requireAuth, and doesAuth by moving all the
extra parameter data into the environment, using Maybes as needed. Then all of
these functions will be simple transformers: each one takes a monad and gives a
monad, possibly wrapping in some logic that produces an updated environment for
the wrapped monad.

  Note that the env type may need to be changed in some cases. For example, different
  handlers will want different target types for their incoming JSON.

  These transformers should take in any ReaderT wrapping any ToActionM and should
  produce a ReaderT wrapping an ActionM.
